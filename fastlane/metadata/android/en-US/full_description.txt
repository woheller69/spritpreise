Gas Prices Germany provides the prices that the petrol stations report to the market transparency office.
You can choose your own locations and get current gas prices.
Clicking on a gas station in the list or on the icon in the widget shows the gas station in a map application.
You can also allow the app to use GPS. If you do so and have the app widget installed the position will be updated from time to time and the first tab in the app and the widget will show gas stations for your current location. (This will overwrite the city in your first tab.)
You can also enter your favourite brands in settings. In this case the list in the app will mark your favourite brands
with a star and the widget will show the closest station of one of these brands if available in the search radius.
You can set your preferred fuel type. In this case it is also possible to sort results by price.
